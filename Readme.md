In this project, you will practice using for loops.  Your code will be part of class ForLoopPractice. You have four tasks, each of which will be completed in a separate method.
 
** Note:  Do not add a new line at the end of your output.

- Part I:  In method oneToTwenty(), print out the numbers from 1 – 20 on one line with spaces in between the numbers.
 
- Part II:  In method evenOneToTwenty(), print out the even numbers from 1 – 20 on one line with spaces in between the numbers.
 
- Part III:  In method sumOneToTwenty(), print out the sum of the numbers from 1 – 20.
 
- Part IV:  In method blaFiveTimes(), print out “BLA” 5 times, with spaces between each “BLA”.
 
- Part V:  Once you have completed Parts 1 – IV, go back to any of your methods that produce blank spaces at the beginning or end of the line.  Fix your code so that there are no spaces there (at the beginning or end of the line).
